# NWNHotkeys
a small tool designed to help quickly buy multiples of an item from shops in the game Neverwinter Nights

simple to use, just run the script and the tool will open up, hover your mouse over the item you want to buy in game while the tool is running, then press `CTRL + F`. when you do this it will buy 10 of the item you had your mouse hovering over (assuming the shop has enough stock).

the tool also allows you to edit the amount of items you want to purchase by changing the number in the "Buy Count" box then hitting the update button. **Note:** only numbers will be permitted inside this box
you may also change the hotkey used to trigger the action by clicking Quick Buy box and pressing your preferred key combination **Note:** single keys are not permitted to avoid accidentaly activation.

there is an options tab that will allow you to set the tool to always be on top of other windows, as well as a transparency bar to change the visibility of the window.

# Important
Please be sure if you wish to use this in a multiplayer server that you ask if it's allowed before doing so, any misuse  of this tool is your own fault and backlash due to that will be of your own making.
